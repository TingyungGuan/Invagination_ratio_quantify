# Invagination_ratio_quantify
A mesh-based pipeline for quantifying invagination ratio of nucleus via curvature classification.

# Features
Automatically split complex meshes into connected components.

Simplify meshes while preserving structural integrity.

Estimate principal curvatures using patch fitting.

Classify surface regions as concave or convex based on curvature.

Quantify the invagination ratio (concave area / total surface area).

Export classification results and high-quality visualizations (optional via PyVista or Matplotlib).
